=head1 NAME

Chat::iFly - An interface to the iFlyChat service.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Chat::iFly;
 
 my $chat = Chat::iFly->new(
    api_key                 => 'afsdadfafdsadfsafsd',
    static_asset_base_uri   => '//www.myserver.com/ifly',
    ajax_uri                => '//www.myserver.com/chat/login'
 );
 
 my $html_to_inline_into_page = $chat->render_html;
 
 my $response_to_chat_login = $chat->render_ajax({
    id          => 4321,
    name        => 'Joe Blow',
    avatar_uri  => '//www.myserver.com/uploads/joe.blow.avatar.jpg',
    profile_uri => '//www.myserver.com/users/4321',
 });


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A wrapper needed to authenticate to L<iflychat.com>.

=head2 Setup

You'll need to go here L<https://iflychat.com/iflyapi/index> and register for an API Key. You'll specify that using C<api_key> passed to the constructor.

You'll need to copy the C<public> folder from this distribution onto your web server somewhere. You'll specify where that is using the C<static_asset_base_uri> passed tot he constructor.

You'll need to build 2 things into your web server:

=over

=item Inline HTML

You'll need to inline the result of C<render_html> into any web page where you want the chat to appear.

=item AJAX Method

You'll need to set up an ajax method in your app that returns the result of C<render_ajax>. You'll pass the URL where that can be found into the constructor using C<ajax_uri>.

=back

And finally you need to call C<update_settings> to tell the iFly servers what your settings are.

=head2 generate_anonymous_user()

Generates an anonymous user hash reference to be used with C<get_key> or C<render_ajax>.

=head2 fetch_anonymous_name( )

Retrieves a random name from the iFly servers for anonymous users. This is called by C<generate_anonymous_user> and probably doesn't need to be used by you.

=head2 get_key( user )

This method is used to essentially log a user into the chat system. It generates a key that is used by the javascript to communicate back to the chat server.

=over

=item user

A hash reference containing the definition of a user. If this is an anonymous user then generate it using C<generate_anonymous_user>.

=over

=item id

The unique id of the user. It can be any alphanumeric string, and cannot contain special characters or start with a number. I recommend hex encoding your string and then prepending "ifly" on it to create a string that fits their ID scheme.

=item name

The name or username of the user.

=item is_admin

Defaults to 0. Can be set to 1 if the user should have chat admin privileges.

=item custom_roles

Defaults to C<normal>. Ignored entirely if C<is_admin> is set to 1. You can also pass in a hash of custom roles (not admin or normal) that will be used as CSS classes for styling. For example:

 {
    1   => 'cool',
    2   => 'slick',
 }

=item avatar_uri

A URI string that references a picture used to identify the user.

=item profile_uri

A URI string that will link other users to this user's profile on the web site.

=item relationships_set

This allows you to set up buddy lists within the chat. It is a hash reference taking the form of:

 {
    1   => {
        name        => 'friend',
        plural      => 'friends',
        valid_uids  =>  ['user_id_1', 'user_id_5', 'user_id_3']
    },
    2   => {
